# **Resume Classification System**  

This project is about automatically categorizing resumes into different job roles using **machine learning**.  

### **How It Works:**  

1. **Load the Data**  
   - The dataset contains resumes along with their job categories.  

2. **Analyze & Visualize**  
   - Shows unique job categories and their counts.  
   - Uses bar and pie charts to visualize the data.  

3. **Clean the Resume Text**  
   - Removes unnecessary elements like links, hashtags, and special characters.  
   - Prepares text for analysis.  

4. **Find Important Words**  
   - Identifies the most common words in resumes (excluding stopwords).  
   - Uses a **word cloud** for better visualization.  

5. **Convert Job Categories to Numbers**  
   - Uses **Label Encoding** to turn job roles into numerical values.  

6. **Convert Text into Features**  
   - Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform text into numerical data for model training.  

7. **Train & Test Split**  
   - Divides data into **80% training** and **20% testing** for evaluation.  

8. **Train the Model**  
   - Uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to predict job categories.  

9. **Check Accuracy**  
   - Measures performance using accuracy scores and a classification report.

### **Why KNN?**  
KNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm that:  
‚úÖ Requires no complex training  
‚úÖ Adapts well to different data patterns  
‚úÖ Works great for small datasets  
‚úÖ Handles multiple categories  

### **Results Comparison:**  

| Model        | Accuracy  | Verdict  |  
|-------------|-----------|----------|  
| **Na√Øve Bayes**  | **8.8%**  | ‚ùå Poor performance  |  
| **SVM**  | **50%**  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Average  |  
| **KNN**  | **79.4%**  | ‚úÖ Best performer!  |  

### **Why KNN Performed Best?**  
- It works well with small datasets.  
- Focuses on **similarity** between resumes rather than making rigid assumptions.  
- Doesn‚Äôt struggle with class imbalances like SVM.  

### **Final Verdict:**  
**KNN is the best choice for this project! üöÄ**
